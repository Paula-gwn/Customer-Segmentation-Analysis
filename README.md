Customer Segmentation Analysis Using PCA and K-Means

Project Overview

This project explores e-commerce customer behavior using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering.
By analyzing customer data, this study aims to identify distinct segments to help businesses implement targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and standardized numerical data.

Dimensionality Reduction: Used PCA to reduce the dataset to two components for visualization while retaining most of the variance.

Clustering: Implemented K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer groups.

Visualization: Visualized clusters and PCA results for actionable insights.

Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized data on e-commerce customer behavior, including:

Demographics

Behavioral metrics like session duration

Purchase frequency

Membership type

This dataset is designed to simulate real-world scenarios businesses face.

Technologies Used

Python Libraries:

pandas, numpy for data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

Visualizations
1. PCA Scatter Plot
Visualizes data in two principal components:

2. Elbow Curve
Determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method:

3. Customer Clusters
Displays distinct customer segments in reduced dimensions:

Insights and Next Steps
Customer Segments:
Each cluster represents a unique group with shared behavioral traits. Businesses can tailor strategies like targeted advertisements or loyalty programs for each segment.

Further Steps:

Finalizing the cluster report for stakeholders and marketing strategies recommendations.
Exploring advanced clustering techniques like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
